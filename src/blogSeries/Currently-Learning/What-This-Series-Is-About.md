## Hi!

&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you're new here, **welcome!** I'd introduce myself, but lets face it, you probably came here from the home page and already have at least know a little bit about who I am (plus, being a developer, I try not to repeat myself or do any repetitive tasks... because well, thats the whole point).

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Anyway, as you might know, being a developer means being on a constant journey of learning. I am currently on that journey. If I want to work at the companies I want to work at, and eventually do all the things I want to do, I need to become WAAAY better at what I do. Also, I like to learn new stuff.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

## So, how am I going to become better, you ask?

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Simple! As I said earlier, I like to learn. **So, every time I begin the journey to learn something new, I am going to write about it. I plan on writing about why I am learning what I am learning, how I am learning it, what tutorials I end up following, something interesting that I discovered that I did not expect, and, _most importantly_, what I am going to build, completely unguided and on my own, to cement everything I just learnt.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Why? Because I think I will understand frameworks, languages, concepts and tools way better if I write about them. Plus, it would be cool to have a "single source of truth" on all the things I've learnt so I can refer back to them as and when needed. Plus plus, maybe reading my explanation might help someone else understand something. Plus plus plus, it'll be an excuse for me to improve my writing skills, my communication skills and maybe some recruiter at some cool startup might see this and think, "Hey, this dude is pretty funny, cool, knows at least a little bit of what he's talking about and I like all the gifs! Maybe I should give him an interview... nah! Let me just offer him the job!".

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I know, sounds pretty dumb... but hey, I said **maybe**! Also, just a heads up, I am a hopeless optimist (if you didn't figure that out already). Also, another heads up, get ready to see a lot of gifs. I like gifs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, thats what this series is about. I'll see you in the following posts. Ciao for now.

**P.S** if you're wondering how I'm pretty sure you came from the home page (or at the very least from the main blog page), its because the way this blog is built — by yours truly, btw —, you cant access any specific posts through the URL directly because I'm passing titles and accent colors through the `Link` component state in React. Not great, I know! But hey, its a start. I'm working on it. Hopefully it'll be done by the time you're reading this.
