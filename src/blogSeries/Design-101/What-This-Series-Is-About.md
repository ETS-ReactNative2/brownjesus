## Hi!

&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you're new here, **welcome!** I'd introduce myself, but lets face it, you probably came here from the home page and already have at least know a little bit about who I am (plus, being a developer, I try not to repeat myself or do any repetitive tasks... because well, thats the whole point).

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Anyway, as you might know, being a developer means being on a constant journey of learning. I am currently on that journey. If I want to work at the companies I want to work at, and eventually do all the things I want to do, I need to become WAAAY better at what I do. Also, I like design.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

## So, how am I going to become better, you ask?

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Simple! **As I said earlier, I like design. So, I am going to force (read: challenge) myself to design something once a week, and write about it.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;

Why? Because I think that if I write out my entire thought process behind a design it might actually help me figure out the follies of my design and help me get better the next time around. Plus, it gives me an excuse to browse through dribbble and actually learn from professionals and imitate (read: get inspired by) them. Plus plus, it'll be an excuse for me to improve my writing skills, my communication skills and maybe some recruiter at some cool startup might see this and think, "Hey, this dude is pretty funny, cool, has clearly designed some KEWL stuff and I like all the gifs! Maybe I should give him an interview... nah! Let me just offer him the job!".

&nbsp;&nbsp;

I know, sounds pretty dumb... but hey, I said **maybe**! Also, just a heads up, I am a hopeless optimist (if you didn't figure that out already). Also, another heads up, get ready to see a lot of gifs. I like gifs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

So, thats what this series is about. I'll see you in the following posts. Ciao for now.

**P.S** if you're wondering how I'm pretty sure you came from the home page (or at the very least from the main blog page), its because the way this blog is built — by yours truly, btw —, you cant access any specific posts through the URL directly because I'm passing titles and accent colors through the `Link` component state in React. Not great, I know! But hey, its a start. I'm working on it as you read this. Hopefully it'll be done by the time you're done reading this.
